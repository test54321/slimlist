h1. Slimlist

The *Slimlist* is an ultra-lightweight video playlist implementation build 
in javascript. Easily create gorgeous looking video playlists that you
can embed on your website or blog.

h2. Why is this awesome?

* *Extremely customizable*. The problem with flash playlist implementations 
	is that they all look the same. Yeah, maybe you get a few themes to choose from,
	but is that really what you want? With the Slimlist, you use a combination
	of css and javascript to _really_ customize your playlist. Just take a look at 
	some of the example themes to see how flexible it is.

* *Ultra-lightweight*. This playlist is framework-less. We don't try to sneak in
	jQuery, prototype, or even swfobject for that matter. The whole thing is only
	6K. And that's uncompressed!

* *Embed anything*. Slimlist "plays" anything. Embed video from anywhere:
	YouTube, vimeo, dailymotion. It even works with images, documents, SWFs, HTML, 
	whole webpages! Whatever!

* *Plugs in to Wistia*. If you use Wistia, you can grab a playlist data feed 
	directly from a project in your account and Wistia will act as your playlist
	management console. Rearrange sections and media and your embedded player
	will update in real time. Use Wistia's advanced video analytics to see exactly
	who's watching your video and how they're watching it.

* *Open source*. Fork it, change it, improve it!


h2. Data feed

The Slimlist accepts a json data feed in the following format.
See `movie_trailers.json` for a working example of this feed.

	[
		// the first playlist
		{ id: 1,														// A unique id for the playlist
			name: 'Playlist One', 						// The name of the playlist
			medias: [
				{
					id: 1,												// a unique idea for this item
					name: 'My first video',				// the title of this item
					thumbnail: {									// a thumbnail image for this item
						width: 100,
						height: 60,
						url: 'http://brendan.com/images/video1.jpg'
					},
					embed: '<embed>...</embed>'		// the HTML embed code for this item
				
				}, {
					id: 2,
					name: 'My second video',
					thumbnail: {
						width: 100,
						height: 60,
						url: 'http://brendan.com/images/video2.jpg'
					}
				}
			]
